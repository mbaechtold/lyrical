Man, we used to be brothers<br />
Superheroes and warriors<br />
Cowboys and Indians, train drivers<br />
Everything rolling through the endless summers<br />

But everything changes<br />
You got married had children<br />
And I don't have your number<br />
The one I can remember is that place you used to live with your parents<br />

But in the stillness of the moment it takes for a Polaroid picture<br />
To capture our faces forever and<br />
The world has turned a touch on its axis<br />
And the only thing certain is<br />
That everything changes<br />

And they closed the Astoria<br />
At the end of last summer<br />
The place we earned our pedigrees<br />
Scene of our victories<br />
Sanctuary in the centre of London<br />

Now they're building a railway<br />
To track the vanquished to Versailles<br />
And singalongs on on<br />
But they're singing different songs<br />
In rooms that we don't know on the other side of the city<br />

But in the stillness of the moment it takes for a Polaroid picture<br />
To capture our faces forever and<br />
The world has turned a touch on its axis<br />
And the only thing certain is<br />
That everything changes<br />

So honey I just need a little time<br />
To take a little time today<br />
To save all the triumphs and tragedies<br />
Before they slip away<br />
Before they slip away<br />

Let go of the little distractions<br />
Hold close to the ones that you love<br />
Because we won't all be here this time next year<br />
So while you can take a picture of us<br />

Let go of the little distractions<br />
Hold close to the ones that you love<br />
Because we won't all be here this time next year<br />
So while you can take a picture of us<br />

Take a Polaroid picture<br />
(Let go of the little distractions)<br />
(Hold close to the ones that you love)<br />

Take a picture of us to show<br />
We all want you to see where time goes<br />

So in the stillness of the moment<br />
Make sure you take a Polaroid picture<br />
And keep it with you forever to<br />
Remind yourself that everything changes<br />
But there was this one time<br />
Man there was this one time<br />
When things were okay...<br />
