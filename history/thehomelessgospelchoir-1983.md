The policeman asked me who I'm tryna' be<br />
I said I'm not sure what you mean<br />
He asked me where I'm going to at such a break neck speed<br />
I said I've been in standstill traffic since nineteen eighty-three<br />

The priest reached out his hand and said a prayer for me<br />
I said I'm not sure if the blind can see<br />
He said that Jesus Christ is the only highway that I'll need<br />
I said I've been in standstill traffic since nineteen eighty-three<br />

I fell in love with a girl who's not married to me<br />
Lindsey cried and said that I'd smashed all her dreams<br />
She asked me where I'm going to now that I've fucked up everything<br />
I said I've been in standstill traffic since nineteen eighty-three<br />

I met god this afternoon<br />
She asked me where I'd been<br />
I said the devil tricked me into buying all his sin<br />
She said what a shame it must be to be deceived<br />
I said I've been getting used to it for longer than you'd believe<br />
I've been getting used to it for longer than you'd believe<br />
I've been getting used to it for longer than you'd believe<br />

I've been getting used to feeling this lonely<br />
I thought that punk rock would die on the cross for me<br />
But I've been looking for salvation since nineteen<br />
