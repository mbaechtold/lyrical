Just one more drink and then I should be on my way home<br />
I'm not entirely sure what you're talking about<br />
I've had a really nice time, but my dogs need to be fed<br />
I must say that in the right light, you look like Shackleton<br />

Comment allez-vous ce soir?<br />
Je suis comme ci comme Ã§a<br />
Yes, a penguin taught me French<br />
Back in Antarctica<br />

I could show you the way shadows colonize snow<br />
Ice breaking up on the bay off the Lassiter coast<br />
Light failing over the pole as every longitude leads<br />
Up to your frostbitten feet, oh, you're very sweet<br />
Thank you for the flowers<br />
And the book by Derrida<br />
But I must be getting back<br />
To dear Antarctica<br />

Say, do you have a ship and a dozen able men<br />
That maybe you could lend me?<br />

Oh, Antarctica
